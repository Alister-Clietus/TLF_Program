Python flask is a micro-framework written in python. It is used for building web applications. [TinkerHub donation page](https://github.com/tinkerhub-org/donation-page) is an example for a web app made with flask

## Why learn Flask ❓

1. Flask is a micro-framework. Means it is simple and can be extended to add more stuffs like database
2. Simple as well as best option to build a backend for something you wrote in python - for example a ML model

## Install and setup stuffs 🚧

Some of the things you need and need not for learning Flask

1. A laptop (windows/linux/mac/whatever) ✔️
2. Install [Python](https://github.com/tinkerhub-org/TinkerHub-Learning-Paths/tree/main/learning/Python) ✔️
3. A simple code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/) ✔️

Install python flask using following command

```bash
$ pip install Flask
```

## Learn more about web apps 📗

- Read this [forword from flask docs](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/foreword/#what-does-micro-mean)
- Read about [REST, RESTful, API..etc](https://wkrzywiec.medium.com/rest-restful-web-service-api-soap-whats-the-difference-4f101953d0bd)

## Flask mega tutorial 🍗

[Flask mega tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) is the best place to learn flask.

💡 make sure you try out everything mentioned in the mega tutorial

## Learn SQLAlchemy 📂

[Learn SQLAlchemy](https://auth0.com/blog/sqlalchemy-orm-tutorial-for-python-developers/) for connecting db to your flask web apps

## Learn Pytest for adding tests 🔩

Writing tests will help you ensure that making new changes won't break anything you already wrote

💡 learn how to [write tests using pytest](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/testing/) for flask web apps

## Become a Flask pro with best practicies 🔱

## Handling errors & finding solutions 🕵️‍♀️

- Flask errors are self explanatory. Read more [here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/master/debugging/#:~:text=To%20enable%20the%20debugger%2C%20run,enables%20the%20debugger%20and%20reloader.&text=FLASK_ENV%20can%20only%20be%20set%20as%20an%20environment%20variable.)
- Pretty much all errors in flask can be googled for figuring out !

## Steps for doing projects 👩‍💻

1. Find out a project idea
2. Setup the developer environment (IDE, packages...etc)
3. Create project directory with the help of this [layout](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/layout/)
4. Write your web app logic
5. Write routes, connect db using sqlalchemy if needed
6. Add unit tests
7. Deploy your flask web app to [heroku](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deploy-python-flask-app-on-heroku/) or some other platform
